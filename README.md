# Clinical Learning Ontology (CLO)

Clinical Learning Ontology is aimed to capture clinical information for better learning and practicing medicine in learning health systems. One urgent goal of CLO is to enable international LHS communities to evaluate the new generation of AI tools based on large language model (LLM) and generative pre-trained transformers (GPT), such as the ChatGPT chatbot from OpenAI, for health care applications. The sudden rise of ChatGPT has revealed the lack of adequate standard datasets available publicly for comprehensive assessment of GPT tools. This CLO project is intended to encourage global collaborations in building and applying CLO to study clinical applications of generative AI.
